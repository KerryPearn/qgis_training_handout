This is completely unrelated to QGIS.\\

This document was created using \LaTeX{} (using TeXstudio, a cross-platform open-source \LaTeX{} editor). I found it easier to format my document than using word, and I believe that the overall appearance is more professional.\\

In case you were interested in giving \LaTeX{} a go, I wanted to share with you the main resource I used to help me get started. It definitely made my first steps a lot easier.

I did not watch the corresponding video, so I don't know how useful it is. But for completeness, it is here:
